                        <p>Bahir Dar is a growing city in Ethiopia. It is their largest tourism location and is diverse
                            in
                            culture. I chose this city because I wanted to challenge myself to learn about a place I’ve
                            never
                            heard of before. To accomplish this, I dug for as much information that the internet could
                            provide
                            on the city and its history.</p>

                            cultures intertwining, while the circle symbolizes peace. Together it is a representation of
                            how they still manage to find peace through poverty in some areas and as the city rapidly
                            grows with diversity.

                            in the imagery I was able to find through my research. This includes monasteries, tourist
                            photos, and general history of the city.

                        <h2>Typography</h2>
                        <p>An old style serif type was key to bringing out the long history of the city. I debated on
                            having just the logo represent the deep rooted history, but I knew that it would have to be
                            in the type as well so I went with LTC Italian Old Style. Then to support, Neue Kabel was a
                            good fit that didn’t distract from the name of the city, but also represents it’s
                            modernization and rapid growth.

                        <p>The colors were inspired by the city's biggest tourist attraction, Blue Nile Falls and Blue
                            Nile River. The river and falls are important to the endemic fauna and people that live
                            there. The green is to represent the nature aspect of the environment and tranquility. The
                            gold is seen in the environment as well, but it also represents the wisdom that comes with
                            the city’s history. Those two come together to form peace at the top which is the circle in
                            a darker blue, representing a calm, serene, peaceful form.
