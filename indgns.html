                        <p class="hanging_indent">&#8220;Indgns&#8221; started as “Indigenous”, a clothing brand trying
                            to shed light on different cultures. The designs were more telling and loud, not leaving
                            much for interpretation. Now, indgns is about portraying aspects of the human experience
                            through our eyes and expressing it not only in the products, but in the visuals surrounding
                            it. This would be done through some telling, but also leaving room for interpretation to
                            encourage the viewer to think. The website should be an experience on its own. Encouraging
                            visitors to engage, but not pressuring&nbsp;a&nbsp;sale.</p>

                            make a series of staggered images that look out of place, but are actually within an

                            their attention with content and products presented in an artistic way, rather than product
                            focused. Something that people would want to experience more than once, creating a strong
                            bond between the visitor and the brand. Using space and a grid system to organize content to
                            lead visitors through the page.

                        <p>Started with a design brief, then a site map and style guide. Created two different
                            wireframes and then three drafts from those wireframes. The idea was to have unique options
                            to explore different routes of getting the feeling of the brand to be expressed throughout
                            the page. Using all original content for each draft and the final site.

                        <h2>Typography</h2>
                        <p>I decided to use Google Fonts for this project due to its ease of use and optimization. I
                            went with Jura for the main header because it is of the Eurostile form, which has a sort of
                            uniformity throughout the letterforms and is geometric. This is important because as humans
                            we all have the same underlying structure, and are built this way from the collective
                            experience of our ancestors. That is why I used it for “Connect” as well because through
                            that same
                            structure and human experiences, we can all connect initially. EB Garamond for
                            “Series” was
                            appropriate to portray a historical feeling, the series section is almost like a
                            record/bible for the current release. The “Scenes” button needed a modern-vintage style with
                            grace since this section will have a mix of present day and past scenes in its imagery. To
                            accomplish this I went with Josefin Sans. People are so complex, and when in their comfort
                            spaces, are organic and expressive. With that said, the “People” button needed to be a
                            handwritten style typeface Gloria Hallelujah. Libre Franklin was used for the headers and
                            captions as a
                            supporting text to the imagery. It doesn’t demand a lot of attention on its own and is
                            legible.

                        <p>The colors for the website were taken from the brands upcoming products, with a focus on
                            keeping it simple; letting most of the color come from the original imagery. The orange used
                            is an inviting and eye catching color and used subtly as an accent in certain areas to
                            highlight text when
