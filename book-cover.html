                        <p>I picked three episodes from the “This Is Love” podcast and turned them into a trilogy of
                            book
                            covers. Starting with &#8220;The Wolves&#8221;, a story about the dynamic relationships of
                            wolves at the Yellowstone National Park with a focus on two wolves. The challenges for these
                            two wolves to live up to the expectations of their packs conflicting with their bond. The
                            next episode I selected, &#8220;Something Large and Wild&#8221;, is about a teenage swimmer
                            who encounters a baby whale. She then realizes that the baby whale is lost and helps it find
                            it's mother, all while being astonished by this experience and the sensations she felt.

                        <h2>Challenge</h2>
                        <p>Design the book cover for the first episode in the trilogy, then having
                            consistent
                            features
                            throughout the rest of the trilogy design to connect them. The book cover must be
                            interesting enough
                            to entice the viewer, but also be a representation of the key elements of the story. To
                            achieve
                            that, I knew I needed the covers to have a sense of&nbsp;mystery.

                        <h2>Solution</h2>
                        <p>After experimenting with different ideas, I chose a cover based on its ability to portray
                            a
                            vital
                            part to the story while catching the viewers attention. I used the concept of having an
                            almost
                            mirrored look, but it’s two similar looking scenes that demonstrate an important aspect
                            or
                            mood
                            of
                            the story for each episode. “The Wolves” portrays dusk and dawn, which are the times
                            when
                            the
                            wolves
                            are most active. The mountains symbolize the range of obstacles the main character had
                            to
                            overcome.
                            “Something Large and Wild” offers the same mystery that the main character experiences
                            when
                            she
                            wonders what is causing the sensations she felt while swimming. The top half is the
                            surface
                            and
                            bottom is the dark depths of the ocean. In “Into The Ice”, the main character gets lost
                            in
                            an
                            iceberg. She finds her way out by following these small, glowing, translucent organisms.
                            They
                            light
                            her way out of the iceberg. The top and bottom split of the cover symbolizes the depths
                            of
                            the
                            ocean, but also her confusion of which way is up and down.
